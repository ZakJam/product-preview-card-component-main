### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

1. I tried to use a different technique to work with font-size this time , i used the calc() function , it doesn't work out well because i can't put a maximum , instead with clamp in can. 
2. I learnt to use create variable without using Sass , just in pure css. 


### Continued development

- I need to to search and see if there are other way beside the clamp() function for responsive text
